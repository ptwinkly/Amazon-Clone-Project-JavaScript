## JavaScript Amazon Clone Project
This project was completed as part of [JavaScript Tutorial Full Course](https://youtu.be/EerdGm-ehJQ) by SuperSimpleDev on YouTube. It served as a practical application of basic JavaScript concepts. For HTML and CSS, I have already learned the important skills and concepts in the previous [HTML and CSS full course](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc).

### Lesson include:
- JavaScript Basics
- Numbers and Math
- Strings
- HTML CSS Review, console.log
- Variables
- Booleans and If-Statements
- Functions
- Objects
- Document Object Model (DOM)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Together
- Arrays and Loops
- Advanced Functions
- Amazon Project and Intro to Git
- Modules
- External Libraries
- Testing
- Testing Frameworks
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Intro to Backend, Callbacks, Async Await
- Promises and fetch
- Async Await

### My Contribution & Learning:
The course mainly focused on the foundational JavaScript. I followed along with the code implementation under the instructor's guidance to better understand the development process and JavaScript concepts. However, I made sure that I didn't just follow along and copy the code without understanding how it works or why it is important for me to know. The followings are what I learned through the project.

* **Implementing core JavaScript concepts in practical exercises:** I actively built online retailer clone, Amazon,  where I got to handle DOM manipulation, event listeners, and local storage for persistence. Together with small projects along the way such as 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Simple To-do list', and 'Coin Flip Game', these allowed me to solidify my understanding of variables, data types, operators, and control flow.

* **Learning best practices for clean code and working algorithm:**  I focused on writing readable and maintainable JavaScript by consistently using meaningful variable names and organizing my code into functions for modularity, which will be crucial for future projects. Moreover, I have learned to follow the working algorithm to make the process more efficient and organized. For example, the instructor divided the process to work with each part into three steps also known as MVC technique: 1) Save data (Model) 2) Generate HTML (View) 3) Make it interactive (Controller)

* **Developing interactive user interfaces:**  I focused on making web pages dynamic by using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. For instance, when a customer adds a product into their cart, the number showing above the cart will show the quantity of products added.

* **Learning and practicing OOP concepts:**  I gained a solid grasp of procedural programming through structured functions and began exploring object-oriented concepts by defining basic objects and their methods (e.g., a Cart object with cartItem property and an addToCart method). I also learned important elements of OPP including Class and Inheritance. The example of using OOP concept in the project is the Cart and Product class which include class properties and functions for each class.

* **Gaining proficiency in asynchronous JavaScript** I learned how to use setTimeout and setInterval to manage time-based events and understand the concept of the event loop. I also began exploring different way to connect to the server and handle asynchronous including Callback, XHR, Promise, Fetch, Async Await, grasping how to handle asynchronous operations more effectively.

* **Practicing testing, trying testing framework (Jasmine) and error handling:** I explored testing process starting with manual tests for quick testing, automated testing using code to test, and testing framework like Jasmine to create more complicated tests. Moreover, I practiced handling error such as using try and catch for unexpected errors.

* **Practicing Git version control and push code to Github** I haved practically learned and used Git for tracking my code and saving my project by pushing code into Github. This gave me a good understanding of Git version control.

### Additional project improvement:
These are some additional improvements I have made and planned to make in order to enchance my skills, since these functions are not instructed in the course but inclueded in the complete Amazon clone web example provided by the instructor.
(Note : ✅ means the improvement has been added)
1. [amazon.html] Show “Added!” label for a certain time after clicking “Add to cart”
2. [checkout.html] Make update & save quantity button interactive ✅
3. [checkout.html] Update order page when clicking place your order
4. [checkout.html] When the cart is empty, show add some texts to show that the cart is empty and add one button to go back to the home page. Also, grey out place your order button.
5. [checkout.html] After a customer click 'place your order', reset the cart quantity to zero
6. [orders.html] Make 'buy it again' button interactive
7. [orders.html] Make track package button interactive

### Challenges Faced:
When the code started to be more complex, I found it quite challenging to manage and organize. However, following the working algorithm or MVC technique as stated above is very helpful and make the process less complicated. Furthermore, I have practiced identifying and fixing code errors along the way, which has helped me gain experience in managing errors and bugs and using helpful tools to solve them.

### Technologies Used:

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Demo:
This is how the completed version looks like. [Amazon Clone Demo](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon) <br/>
Note: This isn’t a demo of my actual code, but the website and its functions are about 90% the same.

### Important Note:
1. In order to make the test part work, you need to download and install the Jasmine framework (lib folder) from the source [here](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/tag/v5.1.1)
2. I do not own the images or assets in this project. They are used strictly for educational purposes.
